#Updates

##Day 1

Dallin  1. Working on dallin_branch
        2. 3 register test cases written (input testing)
        3. test_models.py was breaking my front end testing as it 
        locks the database for some reason. It has been placed 
        in folder "test_models_needs_to_be_fixed" as to not interefere 
        with the frontend testing, as I cannot figure out the bug at this point.
        4. Going to finish the rest of the test cases.
